Checkmates To Kasparov
==================
Calculates your Kasparov number (how many jumps it takes for you to have transitively beaten previous world chess champion Garry Kasparov)

-npm install  
-bower install  
-node app/server.js 

Currently scraping the US Chess site to get the data in my own database so that I can calculate Kasparov numbers much faster, as well as allow some other interesting possibilities (number to Nakamura, etc.). Refer to js/scrapes_for_db.js for such scraping/database updating code
