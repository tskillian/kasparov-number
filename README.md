Checkmates To Kasparov
==================

This project started because most novice tournament chess players seem to think, with a high degree of confidence, that there is no way they could have 'transitively beaten' (have beaten someone who has beaten someone else, who has beaten someone else, etc.) Russian chess legend Garry Kasparov. These people clearly underestimate the power of networks. Despite these players being relatively low rated (especially compared to Kasparov) and being on the other side of the world, most US chess players, as long as they have at least 1 win (a way into the network), have Kasparov numbers. On top of that, the numbers are usually smaller than people expect.
